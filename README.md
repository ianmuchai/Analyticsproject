COVID 19 deaths and vaccinations data analytics
COVID-19 Data Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing a COVID-19 dataset to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic. The objective of the study is to explore various aspects of COVID-19 and its effects on different populations.

Dataset Selection
To ensure the relevance of the study, the dataset was carefully selected based on the project's objectives. Only data that is crucial to the analysis was included.

Calculation of Death Percentage
The death percentage represents the likelihood of death among COVID-19 cases. It was calculated by finding the ratio between the total number of deaths and the total number of cases.

COVID-19 Infection Rates
The project examines the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19 in both India and globally. By comparing infection rates and death counts across different locations, we can identify the proportion of the population affected and determine the order of death counts.

Data Segregation by Continent and Income Status
To further analyze the data, it was segregated based on both continent and income status. This allows for a more detailed examination of the COVID-19 impact across different geographical and socioeconomic categories.

Highest Death Counts by Continent
The data is presented to showcase the continent-wise distribution of COVID-19 deaths in descending order. This information helps identify regions with the highest death counts.

Analysis of Vaccination Impact on COVID-19 Deaths
The project incorporates a vaccinated table and combines it with the sorted data to analyze the impact of vaccinations on COVID-19 deaths. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of vaccinations in reducing mortality rates.
